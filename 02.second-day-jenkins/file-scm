Thanks for sharing the screenshot — you're configuring your Jenkins pipeline using **Pipeline script from SCM (Source Control Management)**. Here's a detailed explanation of each section:

---

### ✅ **What You’re Doing:**

You are telling Jenkins to:

* **Pull the pipeline definition (`Jenkinsfile`) directly from a GitHub repository**
* Use the `main` branch
* Use the file named `Jenkinsfile` at the root of the repo

### 🔍 **Breakdown of the Fields:**

| Field                    | Value                                     | Explanation                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SCM**                  | Git                                       | You’re using Git as the version control system.                                                                                  |
| **Repository URL**       | `http://github.com/RKVankini/jenkins.git` | Jenkins will pull your pipeline from this repo. 🔺 **Note:** `http` should ideally be `https` for security.                      |
| **Credentials**          | `- none -`                                | You selected no credentials. Since the repo is public, this is fine. For private repos, you need to set GitHub credentials here. |
| **Branches to build**    | `*/main`                                  | Jenkins will look for the branch named `main`. The `*/` prefix refers to `origin/main`.                                          |
| **Script Path**          | `Jenkinsfile`                             | Jenkins will look for a file named `Jenkinsfile` at the **root** of your GitHub repo.                                            |
| **Lightweight checkout** | ✅ Enabled                                 | Jenkins fetches just the `Jenkinsfile` without cloning the full repo (faster, used in simple cases).                             |

### ✅ Best Practices & Tips:

1. **Use HTTPS Instead of HTTP**
   Change the repository URL to:

   ```
   https://github.com/RKVankini/jenkins.git
   ```

   This is more secure and avoids warnings.

2. **Private Repo?**
   If the repo is private, you’ll need to:

   * Add a GitHub personal access token in **Jenkins > Credentials**
   * Choose that credential from the **Credentials** dropdown

3. **Subdirectory Jenkinsfile?**
   If your `Jenkinsfile` is inside a folder (e.g., `ci/Jenkinsfile`), set:

   ```plaintext
   Script Path: ci/Jenkinsfile
   ```

4. **Want to build on every push?**
   Set up a **webhook** in GitHub to notify Jenkins on code changes.

Let me know if:

* You want help setting up GitHub credentials
* You’re using a `Jenkinsfile` in a subfolder
* You want to trigger the pipeline on push automatically
